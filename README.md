# FinalProject

This project use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Java, Maven, SpringBoot to create a front-end and a back-end for a program
"List of To Buy"

I used Oracle Netbeans 11.3, Visual Studio Code 1.44, Postman 7.23, GIMP 2.10.18 on Windows and Linux Ubuntu

The program let the user to create a list of things to buy the next time they go to the supermarket or any other store. 
The user can create and delete items; the items are saved to a DataFile for use anytime 
even if the server goes out of service for any reason.
